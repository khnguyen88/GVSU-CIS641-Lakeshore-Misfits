# UI/UX Design Rules

## 60/30/10 Rule (Jesse Showalter / Rachel How / Tristan Parker / UXPlanet)

-   60/30/10 Visual Balance Rules for Main Colors

-   Does not to be followed strictly but as a guideline

-   60% of the site should be a dominant color(s)

    -   Background colors

-   30% of the site should be a secondary color(s)

    -   Navigation Bar
    -   Key Sections
    -   Headers or Subheaders
    -   Non-Critical Sections
    -   Non Non-critical buttons

-   10% of the site should be an accent color(s)
    -   Call to action items
    -   Critical Buttons
    -   Critical Sections
    -   Logos
-   Text colors can be excluded from the rule or fall under 30% Category depending on how much it occupies the layout
-   Each % section can have more than one color, but they are divided up evenly.
-   Limit to only 2-4 main colors that fall within the 60/30/10 rules; less is better. This excludes variants, extensions, and semantic/utility colors.

-   Brand Color can fall into any category, depending on user preferences. Usually, it's used as a secondary or accent color.

## Variant and Extensions (Rachel How)

-   Dominant and Secondary Colors can have variants or extensions; consider either the Material Design or Atlassian color system

-   Brand color might need variants depending on the light or dark mode, too.

-   Two version of our accent colors can be provided to ensure it looks good in light and dark mode.

-   Semantic/utility colors outside the color palette can be used to notify success, error, warning, disabled, etc.

## Understanding Colors (DesignerUp)

-   Color is composed of Hue, Tint, Tone, Shade, and Temperature

-   Hue - Dominant color family of the specific color. White, Black, and Gray are never referred to as a hue.

-   Tint - Hue with only white added (or moving towards white).

    -   Lightens color but does not make brighter.

    -   Tint ranges from original color to white.

-   Tone - HUE WITH only gray added (or moving towards gray).

    -   Gray is considered truly neutral and has no pigment other than white and black.

    -   Gray will tone down the intensity of any colors

-   Shade - Hue with only black added (or moving towards black).

    -   Darkens color

    -   Shade ranges from the original color to black.

-   Temperature - How color as being warm or cool is perceived

    -   Warm - Can come from increasing red/yellow tones in the color wheel

    -   Cool - Can come from increasing blue/green tones in the color wheel

    -   The color wheel is split between warm and cool colors

        -   (R, Y, O) = warm
        -   (B, G, P) = cool

    -   Hue shift towards

### Color Models

-   RGB - Color represented by the adding mixture of Red, Green, and Blue

-   HEX - RGB color values represented as hexadecimal

-   HSB / HSV - An alternative way to represent RGB

    -   H: Hue
    -   S: Saturation
    -   V/B: Value/Brightness (The Same)
        -   value or brightness is not impact saturation

-   HSL - An alternative way to represent RGB and HSL / HSV

    -   the saturation impacts lightness

## Colors Harmonies (Adobe / DesignerUp)

-   Monochromatic - Uses one hue with varying saturation and brightness.

-   Analogous - Use hues next to each other on the wheel.

-   Complementary - Use hues that are on the opposite of the color wheels.

-   Split-Complementary - Use hues on either side of the complementing hue.

-   Double-Split Complementary - Uses hues on either side of the main hue and either side of the complementing hue.

-   Triadic - Use three hues spaced evenly along the color wheel.

-   Square - Uses four hues spaced evenly along the color wheel.

-   Play with saturation and brightness to create a more refined palette.

## Color Palette Guide (DesignerUp / Futur Academy)
